# 1. Linked List Cycle
# Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
# Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
# Example 1:
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
# Example 3:
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: false
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list

# 2. Add Two Numbers
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
# Example 1:
# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,0,8]
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
# Example 2:
# Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
# Example 3:
# Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
# Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

# 4. Copy List with Random Pointer
# A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.
# Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
# For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.
# Return the head of the copied linked list.
# The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:
# val: an integer representing Node.val
# random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
# Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.
# Example 1:
# Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
# Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
# Example 2:
# Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
# Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
# Example 3:
# Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
# Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
# Constraints:
# 0 <= n <= 1000
# -104 <= Node.val <= 104
# Node.random is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.
